## 2024-05-15 - [React 19: Goodbye forwardRef]
Learning: React 19 allows passing `ref` as a regular prop to functional components, making `forwardRef` obsolete and simplifying component definitions.
Action: Removed `forwardRef` usage in `src/components/ui/Silk.tsx`, passing `ref` directly to `SilkPlane`. This reduces boilerplate and aligns the codebase with modern React patterns.

Learning: JavaScript ES2024 introduces native `Object.groupBy()` giving us a performant and declarative way to organize array items without writing boilerplate looping or reducing structures.
Action: Replaced manual grouping loops (`events.forEach`) in `CalendarPageNew.tsx` with `Object.groupBy()`. It simplifies complex logic mapping iterables to categorical structures down to one line.
