## 2024-05-15 - [React 19: Goodbye forwardRef]
Learning: React 19 allows passing `ref` as a regular prop to functional components, making `forwardRef` obsolete and simplifying component definitions.
Action: Removed `forwardRef` usage in `src/components/ui/Silk.tsx`, passing `ref` directly to `SilkPlane`. This reduces boilerplate and aligns the codebase with modern React patterns.
